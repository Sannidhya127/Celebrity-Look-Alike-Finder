# Celebrity-Look-Alike-Finder
A celebrity look alike finding program that uses the DeepFace module to traverse through thousands of celebrity pictures and find the closest match

The program uses [Celebrity Face Image Dataset | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishesh1412/celebrity-face-image-dataset) to track down the closest lookalike of a supplied image from the user. The dataset has not been pushed to GitHub for the large size that it sustains. The dataset holds 100 images for each of the following celebrities: 

-   Angelina Jolie
-   Brad Pitt
-   Denzel Washington
-   Hugh Jackman
-   Jennifer Lawrence
-   Johnny Depp
-   Kate Winslet
-   Leonardo DiCaprio
-   Megan Fox
-   Natalie Portman
-   Nicole Kidman
-   Robert Downey Jr.
-   Sandra Bullock
-   Scarlett Johansson
-   Tom Cruise
-   Tom Hanks
-   Will Smith

## How to use
Download the dataset from the above link and paste it in your main directory where the `main.ipynb` file is located. Create a folder called `Samples`. Run the code


**If you supply an image with no face, the program will raise an error**
